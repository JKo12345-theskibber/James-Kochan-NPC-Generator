# NPC Random Generator-Created by James Kochan

## Summary
Hello! My name is James Kochan, I'm a freshman at Voorhees High school. I was tasked with making an NPC Generator for an open world game. The software I designed is easy to use, intuitive, and open for expansion by a coder more advanced than me (a whole lot of people!). In this README, I'll show some highlights of my software, and explain why they were coded like this.
